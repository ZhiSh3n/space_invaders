## Space Invaders

This is Space Invaders reimagined (more or less). The entire game runs off StdDraw, which you can find [here](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html). 
Single entities are made in individual files, and entity groups are also instantiated in separate files. 
To run the game, StdDraw must be imported and the sprite images should also be placed in correct folders.
Includes a starting/ending screen, a score counter, multiple lives, three rows of aliens that randomly shoot projectiles, and very nice FPS. No barricades included.
